[Verse 1]
Took a ride to the end of the line
Where no one ever goes
Ended up on a broken train
With nobody I know
But the pain and the longing's the same when you're dying
Now I'm lost, and I'm screaming for help alone

[Chorus]
Relax, take it easy
For there is nothing that we can do
Relax, take it easy
Blame it on me or blame it on you

[Post-Chorus]
It's as if I'm scared
It's as if I'm terrified
It's as if I'm scared
It's as if I'm playing with fire
Scared
It's as if I'm terrified
Are you scared?
Are we playing with fire?
Relax

[Verse 2]
Oh, there is an answer
To the darkest times
It's clear, we don't understand it
But the last thing on my mind
Is to leave you, I believe that we're in this together
Don't scream, there are so many roads left to run

[Chorus]
Relax, take it easy
For there is nothing that we can do
Relax, take it easy
Blame it on me or blame it on you
Relax, take it easy
For there is nothing that we can do
Relax, take it easy
Blame it on me or blame it on you

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Relax, take it easy
For there is nothing that we can do
Relax, take it easy
Blame it on me or blame it on you
Relax, take it easy
For there is nothing that we can do
Relax, take it easy
Blame it on me or blame it on you
Relax
[Post-Chorus]
It's as if I'm scared
It's as if I'm terrified
It's as if I'm scared
It's as if I'm playing with fire
Scared
It's as if I'm terrified
Are you scared?
Are we playing with fire?
Relax
