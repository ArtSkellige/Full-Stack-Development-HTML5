        <p>
        When the haunting echoes of the Black Marker reverberate through the ruined halls of the USG Ishimura, engineer Isaac Clarke is pushed to his limits. Badly wounded and pursued by grotesque necromorphs, Isaac must survive both his tormentors and the unraveling of his own mind. As darkness consumes the vessel, a desperate fight for life unfolds in corridors where hope is lost—and the only remaining signal is one of sorrow and madness.</p>
